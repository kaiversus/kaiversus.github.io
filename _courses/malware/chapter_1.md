## I. Goals of Malware Analysis Primer  
- The purpose of malware analysis is usually to provide the information you need to respond to a network intrusion.  
- Develop host-based and network `signature`  
    - `Signature`: means the characteristics of the malware, but its not like a character of a malware. It is not about the general nature (character) of malware, but rather the specific patterns, behaviors, or traces it leaves behind. Example, every cats have the same character like ears, 4 legs, tail,.. but each represents different kind of behavior, foot trace,...etc.  

- Host-based signatures (indicators): used to detect malicious code on victim computers.  
- These indicators often identity files created or modified by the malware or specific changes that it makes to the registry.  
    - `Registry`: a hierarchical database that stores the configuration settings required for computer to operate efficiently.
    - `Includes`: 
        + basic boot-up functions
        + user profile information
        + start-up options
        + installed applications and drivers
        + system hardware informations and specific design settings
    - Third-party programs can also use the registry to store their settings
- Malware indicator: focus on what the malware does to a system, not to the characteristics of the malware itself 
*➜ Make more effective in detecting malware in case the malware writer may change their form code, files or delete from the hard disk.*  

- Network signatures: 
    + monitoring (giám sát) net-work traffic to detect malicious code
    + can be created without malware analysis, but MA are usually far more effective  
➜ higher detection rate and fewer false positives.
➜ *Conclusion: figure out exactly how the malware works !!!*

## II. Techniques
| Technique | Level | Definition | Advantage | Disadvantage |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Analysis** | Basic | Examining the executable file without executing it or viewing actual instructions. | Fast and straightforward; provides basic functionality info; can generate simple network signatures. | May miss important behaviors; ineffective against sophisticated malware. |
| **Static Analysis** | Advanced | Loading malware into a disassembler to analyze program instructions and understand its behavior. | Deep understanding of program logic without execution. | Requires knowledge of disassembly, code constructs, and Windows OS. |
| **Dynamic Analysis** | Basic | Running and observing malware behavior in a controlled environment. | No deep programming knowledge required; useful for behavior observation. | Can miss hidden behaviors; malware may evade execution. |
| **Dynamic Analysis** | Advanced | Using a debugger to inspect the internal state of a running malicious executable. | Reveals behaviors difficult to obtain via other methods. | Requires OS, CPU, and assembly knowledge; time-consuming; malware may detect the analysis environment. |
| **Automated Analysis** | Basic | Executing malware in a sandbox (VMware, QEMU, etc.) with a pre-installed OS. | Quick overview of attack techniques and functionality. | Sandbox-aware malware may evade or alter behavior. |
| **Reverse Engineering** | Expert | Manual analysis to fully understand malware internals. | Complete understanding of malware logic. | Most difficult; requires advanced reverse engineering skills. |

## III. Type of Malware
- `Backdoor`: installs itself onto a computer to allow the attacker access to computer with little or no authentication and execute commands on the local system.  
- `Botnet`: Similar to backdoor, but this one spread out to other computer. All computer infected with the same botnet receive the same instructions from a single command-and-control sever.
- `Downloader`: Download and install other malicious code, are commonly installed by attackers when they first gain access to a system.
- `Information-stealing`: collecting and sending the information of infected computer to the attacker
- `Launcher`: launch other malicious programs. Use nontraditional techniques to ensure stealth or greater access to the system.
- `Rootkit`: conceal (che giấu) the existence of other code.Usually pair with other malware, such as backdoor, to allow remote access to the attacker and make the code difficult for the victim to detect.
- `ScareWare`: designed to frighten an infected user into buying their antivirus app to remove the virus. But infact, it’s nothing but remove it’s self LOL.
- `Spam-sending malware`: According to the name, this malware uses the machine to spam, generates income for attackers by allowing them to sell spam-sending services.
- `Worm or Virus`: Copy itself and infect additional computer.
- `SpyWare`: purpose of spying on the end-users, to get the information
- `KeyLogger`: logs the keystrokes, mouseclicks and even screen shots of the end-users
